ðŸ“… Scheduler Helper

This module provides functions to determine whether reports should be sent based
on scheduling frequencies and to execute the report generation process concurrently.

Functions:
- should_send_report: Determines if a report should be sent based on frequency and specified days.
- schedule_reports: Executes the report generation for multiple websites concurrently.
